# project-wk1-refactoring
This is the week 1 project: CODE REFACTOR for UM Bootcamp Online

I was tasked with cleaning up a provided starter code for a webstite. I was respsonsible for condensing the code, and adding semantic elements to make the site more functional for screen readers. This was important to provide people with disabilities better access to the website. It was also important to make the website more optimized for search engines.

The images provided below show the final product of the refactored code.
